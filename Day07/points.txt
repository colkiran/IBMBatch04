Package and Modules
-------------------
Modules are same as Libraries, any python file can be used as a python module. python modules have the same extension as a python .py


Package
-------
package is a folder / directory that is used to store modules.

packages are also compared with a class

in class we have constructor __init__ that gets executed first

even in packages also if we have a __init__.py file it will first get executed


import mymodule
----------------

1. convert the module name from

mymodule.py => mymodule.cpython-311.pyc

and store it in a folder __pycache__



filename.pth

import mymodule
import mymodule as m

import mypackage.mymodule as m

from mymodule import greet
from mypackage.mymodule import Player

from mypackage import *

How do we build a installable  package


Regular Expressions
-------------------
what is the use of regular expressions

* - series of characters
? - single character


dir *.txt = lists out all files with extension .txt

dir ?a*.txt = lists all files with second character as 'a' and extension is .txt
